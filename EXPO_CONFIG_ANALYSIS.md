# Expo Configuration Analysis - FINAL REPORT

## Todo List

- [x] Read and analyze app.json configuration
- [x] Run expo doctor to check current status
- [x] Identify schema validation issues
- [x] Check for non-synced properties in prebuild configuration
- [x] Document findings and recommendations
- [x] Install missing react-native-worklets dependency
- [x] Verify EAS Build compatibility

## Analysis Results

### Current Status ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Project contains native folders (android/)
- ‚úÖ Using Prebuild configuration  
- ‚úÖ Missing peer dependency **RESOLVED**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Prebuild sync issue **IDENTIFIED**

### Issues Found by Expo Doctor

#### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Missing Peer Dependency
```bash
npx expo install react-native-worklets
```
**Status**: Successfully installed! Now 16/17 checks pass.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTIVE: Prebuild Configuration Issue
```
‚úñ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, 
indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, 
EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, scheme, userInterfaceStyle, 
splash, ios, android, plugins.
```

## Current Configuration Analysis

### App.json Configuration
The `app.json` contains several native configuration properties that won't be synced by EAS Build:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "orientation": "portrait",           // ‚ùå Won't sync
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",  // ‚ùå Won't sync  
    "scheme": "myapp",                  // ‚ùå Won't sync
    "userInterfaceStyle": "automatic",  // ‚ùå Won't sync
    "splash": {...},                    // ‚ùå Won't sync
    "ios": {...},                       // ‚ùå Won't sync
    "android": {...},                   // ‚ùå Won't sync
    "plugins": [...]                    // ‚ùå Won't sync
  }
}
```

### Native Folders Status
- ‚úÖ `android/` folder present
- ‚ùå `ios/` folder missing
- Project is partially prebuilt (Android only)

## Impact Assessment

### High Impact Properties (Won't Sync)
1. **Orientation**: App will use native default instead of forced portrait
2. **Icon**: Won't update automatically during builds
3. **Scheme**: Custom URL scheme may not work properly
4. **Interface Style**: Automatic theming may not apply
5. **Splash Screen**: Splash configuration ignored
6. **iOS/Android configs**: Platform-specific settings ignored
7. **Plugins**: Critical functionality plugins may not load

### Risk Level: HIGH for Production Builds
These issues can cause:
- Build inconsistencies between environments
- Missing functionality in EAS Build
- Runtime crashes if plugins don't load
- Incorrect app behavior in production

## SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Full Prebuild (Recommended for Production) üéØ
```bash
# Step 1: Remove existing native folders
rm -rf android/

# Step 2: Regenerate with current app.json config
npx expo prebuild

# Step 3: Commit the native configuration
git add android/
git commit -m "Update native configuration from app.json"

# Step 4: Verify the fix
npx expo doctor
```

### Option 2: Pure Expo Go (For Development Only) ‚ö†Ô∏è
```bash
# Remove native folders to force sync from app.json
rm -rf android/

# Test with Expo Go (development only)
npx expo start
```

## Configuration Sync Status

### Properties that WILL sync (app.json only):
- ‚úÖ `name`, `slug`, `version`
- ‚úÖ `web` configuration
- ‚úÖ `experiments`
- ‚úÖ `extra` configuration

### Properties that WON'T sync (native folders override):
- ‚ùå `orientation`
- ‚ùå `icon`
- ‚ùå `scheme`
- ‚ùå `userInterfaceStyle`
- ‚ùå `splash`
- ‚ùå `ios` configuration
- ‚ùå `android` configuration
- ‚ùå `plugins` array

## Recommended Action Plan

### For Development Environment:
1. ‚úÖ **Done**: Install missing peer dependency
2. üîÑ **Optional**: Use Option 2 for faster development iteration

### For Production Deployment:
1. ‚úÖ **Done**: Install missing peer dependency
2. üîÑ **Required**: Implement Option 1 (Full Prebuild)
3. üîÑ **Required**: Test EAS Build after configuration
4. üîÑ **Required**: Verify all app features work correctly

## Summary

**Current Health Score**: 16/17 checks passed (94%)

‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Missing peer dependency issue  
‚ö†Ô∏è **ACTION REQUIRED**: Choose and implement prebuild strategy

**Next Steps**:
1. Choose prebuild strategy based on deployment needs
2. Implement chosen solution
3. Run `npx expo doctor` to verify 17/17 checks pass
4. Test application functionality
5. Proceed with EAS Build setup

The configuration issues are now clearly identified and solutions are ready for implementation.
